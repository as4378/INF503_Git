# Large Scale Data Structures and Organization

The problems here test the algorithms run time and complexity when scaling to large amounts of data.
The solutions are supposed to be run on High Performance Computing Cluster (we have Monsoon at our University).
Code is implemented mostly in C++. For some problems Python is also used
