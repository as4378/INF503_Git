Large Scale Data Structures and Organization

Solutions to assignments for course I am taking this semester. 
The problems here test the algorithms run time and complexity when scaling to large amounts.
The solutions are supposed to be run on High Performance Computing Cluster.
Code is implemented mostly in C++. For some problems Python is also used
